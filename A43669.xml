            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Reflections upon a Letter out of the Country, to a Member of this preſent Parliament: Occaſioned by a late Letter to a Member of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> concerning the Biſhops lately in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and now under Suſpenſion.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am a great admirer of your Writings, and as ſome curious Obſervers come to know Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures: ſo I came to know the <hi>Letter out of the Country to a Member of this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be one of your Pieces. No Child was ever more like the Father; and I am alſo confirm'd in my Opinion by the concurrent Judgment of other Readers; and I will venture all the Reputation I have, as a Critick in Pamphlets, that it is an Original; for you have a peculiar way of writing, eſpecially Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, which no Man hath, nor any good man can deſire to have in ſuch Perfection as your ſelf.</p>
            <p>One of your Acquaintance, who knows your hand very well, had not read two of the Fourteen Pages, before he cried out this is <hi>Eraſmus</hi> or the Devil: And therefore Sir, when you write the next Libel, neither conceal your own, nor change your Bookſellers Name; for your venomous Stile will diſcover you in every Period, and it is by that we now come to know who you are; but ſince you appear without your <hi>Fiocco,</hi> I ſhall take the liberty to pull off your upper Robes, and ſhew the Wolf under the Sheeps clothing; for ſo I ſhall make it appear you are to the Six Biſhops throughout your whole Letter, under the cover of Friendſhip and Tenderneſs: But Sir, tho' to kiſs and betray with the ſame Breath, may, as times now go, paſs for a venial Sin in a Polititian, yet the World abhors it in a Divine.</p>
            <p>To begin then at the firſt Page, There you ſay, <hi>you approve the deſign</hi> of the Letter to a Member of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>but you do not like the method</hi> which it takes; and you acknowledge the Biſhops to be excellent Perſons, for whom you have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Veneration, but then you ſay in the ſame Period that they <hi>wilfully expoſe themſelves to the rigour of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, Sir, puts me in mind of a Story of the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> concerning a Clergyman of your Acquaintance, whom he called the <hi>Butting Divine;</hi> and ſpeaking of him to one, who was then a great, and now a greater <hi>Church-man;</hi> pray, ſays his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, have a care of him, for he never ſpeaks well of any one of our Clergy-men, but he <hi>buts</hi> them down again. He ſays you are a Learned man, but— and Dr.— is a good Preacher, but—and Dr.— is a Pious man, but— Juſt ſo, Sir, you deal with the good Biſhops in your Letter: You like the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of preventing their Sufferings, <hi>but</hi> you quarrel at the Authors Method; and they are excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for whom you have a particular Veneration, <hi>but</hi> yet they are wilful Men.</p>
            <p>There is a more divine and genuine Principle, which you have often pretended in behalf of others, called Conſcience; and if you had any Charity or Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for them, you would have reſolv'd their Non-compliance into that; but you know very well, that if you could make the World believe that they are <hi>wilful,</hi> they could not believe them to be excellent and venerable Men; for wilfulneſs, as Philoſophers teach us, is either the Effect of weakneſs, as in Children; or of Contempt and Contumacy, as in Men of proud rebellious Spirits, whom the Scriptures call Sons of <hi>Belial;</hi> and if you think they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the former ſence, you can neither count them Exeellent nor Venerable; and if they are ſo in the latter, as you hint plainly in other <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </hi> 16,</note> Places, how can you wiſh <hi>ſome expedient were found out to keep them from ſuffering the vigour of the Law.</hi> Logicians tell us, that ſome Adjuncts deſtroy their Subjects; and that Propoſitions ſignifie nothing, wherein the Terms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict one another; but what is Noncenſe in ſtrict Logick, makes a malicious Figure in Rhetorick, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſome Men and Cauſes, and therefore we find it ſo often in your Reply. But I cannot go on, till I firſt examine your Objection againſt the method of the Letter. The Author of it ſuggeſts ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Motives, upon the conſideration of which, he hopes the Wiſdom of the Parliament will find out ſome Expedient to reſtore the Biſhops. He doth not preſume to name the Expedient, and yet you cenſure this as a Prepoſtrous way of Proceeding, and with great Candor call it <hi>a peremptory preſcribing to the Parliament,</hi> though he Preſcribes nothing at all. But now, Sir, had the Biſhops, according to your directions, <note n="†" place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> agreed upon their own Expedient, and propos'd it to the Parliament, you might as well have called that a peremptory and inſolent Preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Wiſdom of the Parliament, from whom they ought to receive and not to give Propoſals; and that nothing could be more Preſumptuous, than for them to offer their <note n="*" place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> 
               <hi>Projects to the two Houſes, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading their own Laws.</hi> Thus, Sir, you ſee how ill will can make everlaſting Objections againſt any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of effecting a deſign which it doth not like. This
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62186:2"/>in truth is the Caſe with you; you do not like the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Letter in favour of the Biſhops, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you pick quarrels with the Method, though <hi>as you know very well, and no Man better,</hi> there is nothing more common, than for Men, both from the Preſs and Pulpit, to propoſe things to the Conſideration of the Parliament in favour of thoſe, who lie under the preſſure of ſevere Laws, * <hi>without applying firſt unto them.</hi> And why may they not have the common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of other Subjects, of getting Bills of caſe brought into Parliament, by the Intereſt of their Friends in it? You ſay <hi>they obliged the whole Nation by their former Sufferings,</hi> and then methinks they may have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favour which other Diſſenters often found, for whoſe caſe many Motions have been made in ſeveral Parliaments without Petitioning the Houſe.</p>
            <p>I am confident had they Petition'd you, there would have heen no need of Petitioning the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſuch a Condeſcenſion would have gratified your Ambition to ſuch a degree, that you would have wrote ten times better for them, than you have done againſt them, and if I had been worthy to advize their Lordſhips, they ſhould have made timely application to you, and begged your advice and aſſiſtance, with a ſubmiſſion ſutable to ſo great a Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Cap and Cringe of your Metropolitan would for certain have done wonders; it could not but have melted you down into Pity, if not into Tears, in which you can be fluent upon occaſion: But it ſeems old Age has made him as ſtiff as <hi>Mordecai;</hi> he will not Bow nor do Reverence to you; and Sir, you know Ambition can forgive any thing ſooner than that.</p>
            <p>I come now to the buſineſs of the Declaration, which the Biſhops withſtood with ſo much Zeal and Courage; and the Letter in favour of them gives due weight to the Merits of this great Action, which you with your wonted Ingenuity and Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifice endeavour to depreſs. You grant it was a glorious Action, but <hi>then we ought not to magnifie them ſo extreamly for it becauſe it was their Duty.</hi> But Reverend Sir, may we not extreamly magnifie Men for doing their Duty? If not, why were they ſo extreamly magnified here and in <hi>Holland,</hi> at the time of doing of it? and if we may, Why ſhould we not <hi>magnifie</hi> them as much ſtill? Doth this generous Action in which they ventured ſo much, loſe its Merits, as ſome generous Liquors loſe their Spirits in leſs than Eighteen Months time? It was indeed their Duty, becauſe otherwiſe it had been their Sin: But if Men muſt not be as much magnified, as that Author magnifies the Biſhops for doing their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſuch difficult and dangerous Circumſtances, and with the hazard of all that was dear to them in this World; than the Wiſdom of the Church hath been very impertinent, in Celebrating the Sufferings of Martyrs and Confeſſors, and the Apoſtle alſo not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle laviſh in the Praiſes of the Jewiſh Heroes, whom he magnifies extreamly for doing nothing <hi>but what was their Duty to do.</hi> Nay, Sir, <note place="margin">Page <hi>1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi>
               </note> according to your Rule, we are no longer to make <hi>Economiums of him in the Superlative Degree,</hi> for his many and great Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, becauſe they were all the Indiſpenſable Duty of an Apoſtle; but nevertheleſs he boaſted of them, which is more than ever I heard the Biſhops did of that Heroick Action, although you ſuggeſt, as if they did both to God and Man. <note place="margin">Page <hi>9.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Thoſe excellent Perſons have too much Humility, or elſe,</hi> &amp;c. This, Sir, is nothing more or leſs than your old way of <hi>Butting</hi> with new Particles. They are excellent Perſons, and have much Humility; <hi>But</hi> they boaſt too much of one good Action, This, Sir, muſt be your meaning, or elſe you are very impertinent in ſending of them to our Saviours Leſſon of Humility, which all the World knows they have learned much better than your ſelf.</p>
            <p>You go on in the ſame Figure, <note place="margin">Page <hi>9.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>confeſſing they beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves gallantly in that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking; and that it muſt be owned, there never was an Action, by which a whole Nation was more obliged, than by that of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</hi> Now, Sir, if this be not your way of bante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, then why ſhould we not magnifie them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly for it? and the Repreſentatives of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requite them for it too? Can any thing better become them, than to take into their Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the National Obligation of ſuch a meritorious Action, and return it upon the worthy Patriots, by ſaving them who ſaved the Nation from ruin, in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves, as it might have proved, a Sacrifice to Arbitrary Power? Had <hi>Curtius</hi> reviv'd, after he ſtopt the Plague, ſurely the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate had done much more for him, than relax a Law in his Favour, the Merit of ſo brave an Action would have deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great advantage upon his Family: But leſt our Senators ſhould do a mere Negative kindneſs for our celebrated Benefactors, in not ſuffering them to periſh, you <hi>But</hi> down all the Merit of that great Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which before you had ſet up. <note place="margin">Page <hi>1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </note> It was a <hi>Generous piece of Piety,</hi> and the whole Kingdom was obliged by it; <hi>but yet we ſhould be too partial to them,</hi>

Hath a General all the Praiſe of the Victory, becauſe he hath the chief ſhare in the Triumph? Or do the Friends of our Heroic Biſhops, think that all the Praiſe of that eminent Action is due to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a mighty ſhare of it is? They aſcribe no more Praiſe to them, than is ſtrictly due to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals in all great Achievements; nor is this any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to their Seconds, who have their reſpective Parts in it.</p>
            <p>You make indeed a very Pompous recital of the <hi>Nobilty, Gentry, Lawyers, and inferior Clergy, who aſſiſted and ſeconded them it;</hi> theſe you alſo call their Partners: But I dare boldly ſay, none of them, nor all of them together, will pretend to an equal ſhare of Honour
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62186:2"/>with them in that Undertaking, (for they were alone in the Petition, and hazard of Petitioning) and yet they are willing that all their Seconds and Partners, ſhould ſhare as deep in the Reward as themſelves, who were the Principals, and be <hi>Partners</hi> with them in that. For the inferior degrees of Merit in that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Victory over Arbitrary Power are ſo great, that the Seconds and Aſſiſtants may without preſumption pretend to all the favour of all our Legiſlators, which the Letter pleaded for in behalf of the Biſhops; and we heartily wiſh, that all their Adherents in that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether Lords or Commons, or Inferior Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that are in the ſame ſtate of Sufferings, may have relief as well as they.</p>
            <p>Some of thoſe of the Inferiour Clergy; who you ſay, were as forward as the Biſhops, are now in the ſame Condition with them; and had not one of them, who is a Perſon as tall in merit, as any of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, oppoſed the reading of the Declaration with more than ordinary Zeal, Courage, and Reaſon; it had likely been read in ſome of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Churches in <hi>London,</hi> by Men whoſe obſequious Examples, would have had a great Influence over the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, divide the praiſe and thanks of that great Action, into as many parts as you pleaſe, only let the Biſhops have their due ſhare; which you are loth to give them. For in diminution of their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, you tell us, <hi>that it had been of no uſe, had they not been ſeconded ſo bravely,</hi>

It is Recorded in our Hiſtories, to the immortal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Thomas Merckes</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> that he ſtood up alone both againſt King and Parliament in defence of his <hi>Depoſed</hi> Soveraign, when none would, becauſe none durſt ſecond him.

Was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Caſe ever the worſe, becauſe all Men forſook him at his firſt hearing at <hi>Rome?</hi> Pray, Sir, conſider what a trifling Argument it would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Biſhops, if it were true, that they had no Partners with them in their Cauſe. But it is a moſt Impudent untruth; for ſeveral Lords, and other Gentlemen have refuſed the Oath, not to mention Inferior Clergy-men, and <hi>Fellows,</hi> and <hi>Scholars</hi> of Colleges, who are below none of their Brethren, and Colleagues in true Merit. And though, Sir, you have no concern for them, yet many good Men have, and would before now have interceded for them, had they not been hinder'd by the Avarice and Ambition of ſome, who, it may be, as the Letter ſuggeſts, <hi>have already caſt Lots for their Garments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſorry there is occaſion given to think, that ſome Perſons, who ought to be free from this odious Imputation, lie under the ſuſpicion of it; and the beſt way to clear themſelves, will be now to ſhew their zeal and forwardneſs, in endeavouring to prevent the fall of their Brethren, unleſs the whole deſign of your Paper be to let the World know, that their Ruin is reſolved upon; and that they may not fall lamented and pitied, to render them odious before hand.</p>
            <p>You have indeed formerly made many ſplendid, but empty Invective Declamations againſt Perſecution, without diſtinguiſhing of the Cauſes ſuffering: But now, Sir, forgetting what you have written upon this as well as upon other Subjects, you can perſecute great and good Men with delight, and depreſs the Merits of their former Sufferings, even to nauſeouſneſs, telling us plainly again, that you cannot brook their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the ſuperlative Degree, <hi>only</hi> (as you add) <hi>for not taking the Oaths.</hi> But, Sir, <note place="margin">Pag <hi>18.</hi>
               </note> this is another of your malicious Inſinuations; for the Letter doth not make Encomiums on them for that, but for what they did and ſuffer'd for the Nation, in that which you call <hi>the great and glorious Scene;</hi> and though his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums are now and then in the Superlative, yet he makes no Compariſons, as you ſuggeſt; nor doth a Superlative in its nature imply Compariſons any more than the Poſitive Degree. If one, Sir, ſhould ſay, you are a <hi>moſt,</hi> or a <hi>very</hi> learned man, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low but Twenty more may be as Learned as you. But it is no wonder, that the Praiſes of the good Biſhops in the <hi>Superlative</hi> ſhould ſo gall you; for there are ſome Spirits as thirſty of Praiſe as Miſers are of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they cannot bear Rivals in Fame or Greatneſs, but would engroſs, if it were poſſible, the ſame of the whole World; and think all the Honour that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to others, eſpecially in the Superlative Degree, is ſo much taken from themſelves.</p>
            <p>I will now, Sir, accompany you to the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſigned <hi>December</hi> 11th. 1688. and as you were ſo kind to the Biſhops as to make them Judges in their own Cauſes, ſo I will return your civility upon you in making you Judge in yours; and in order to that, I ſhall ask you a Queſtion or two, before I anſwer thoſe which you put to them. Was the Signing of the Declaration in that time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62186:3"/>a Deviation from their Duty, or not? If it were not, then they committed no fault in doing of it, but are ſtill unblemiſhed. If it were, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are culpable. But doth it follow, that becauſe they did one ill indeliberate action upon ſurprize, and in great conſternation then, that they muſt do a deliberate one, ten times worſe, now?</p>
            <p>I can aſſure you, Sir, thoſe good, and learned Men are no ſuch looſe Caſuiſts: it is not with them, <hi>over Shoes, over Boots;</hi> that is no Rule of Practice for them, whatſoever it may be for ſuch as you; nor do <hi>they</hi> underſtand the Modern way of correcting one error by another, and committing a ſecond fault to juſtifie a former, and a third to juſtifie them both.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now, Sir, truly and fairly ſtate that action: and I am very confident no equitable Perſon will think it needs any further Apology.</p>
            <p>At that time the King was withdrawn; all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (which had not deſerted) disbanded; the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble got looſe from the Reins of Government; the common Safety endanger'd. Now under theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, was it a Deviation from their Duty to apply themſelves to the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> who had, by his Declaration, ſet forth, <hi>That he had no other Deſign in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, than to procure a Settlement of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of the Liberties and Properties of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that he would refer all to a free Aſſembly of the Nation in a <hi>Lawful</hi> Parliament.</hi> And at that time the <hi>Prince</hi> being at the head of a Potent Army, had the ſole Power, and a fair opportunity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Publick Peace by taking the Government out of the hands of the riotous <hi>Mob,</hi> whoſe furious Inſolency, and growing Tumults threatned the like deſolation to <hi>London</hi> and other parts of this Nation, that <hi>Maſſianello</hi> formerly brought upon <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being under this inevitable neceſſity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Application to the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> Thoſe good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops intirely truſting in his Highneſſes good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did Sign that Declaration; the ſum of which is, <hi>That they would aſſiſt him in obtaining ſuch a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein our Laws and Liberties may be Secured, the Proteſtant Intereſt Supported, to the glory of God, and the happineſs of the <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> Government of theſe Kingdoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, pray Sir, why ſhould thoſe Biſhops, having under thoſe Circumſtances Sign'd <hi>that Declaration, be unwilling</hi> to be judged for ſo doing, either by the Declaration it ſelf, or by any Perſons whatſoever? But certainly there are ſome in the World, who had need be cautious of paſſing Sentence on the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of other Men. Every reviling cenſure flies in their faces, who have manifeſtly and notoriouſly Deviated from their own <hi>Solenm Declarations and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions</hi> made <hi>deliberately</hi> in <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>ſedate times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to anſwer the Queries you put to the Biſhops, I Reply, That I cannot conceive, that by any rules in <hi>Logick</hi> it can be inferr'd, that becauſe they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to aſſiſt the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> in obtaining <hi>a Free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> wherein the <hi>then <hi>Laws,</hi>
               </hi> &amp;c. might be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and the <hi>then <hi>Eſtabliſhed Government</hi>
               </hi> ſupported, they therefore judged that K. <hi>J.</hi> had <hi>Deſerted</hi> and <hi>Abdicated</hi> his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It is true he had withdrawn his Perſon: but doth every <hi>withdrawing</hi> of a <hi>King</hi> amount to a <hi>Deſertion</hi> and <hi>Abdication?</hi> Several of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have <hi>withdrawn</hi> themſelves, and yet have not been thought to have <hi>Abdicated;</hi> as <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> did, King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> when he eſcaped out of <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Court,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>ſecond,</hi> when he left the Kingdom after <hi>Worceſter</hi> Fight.</p>
            <p>And I muſt tell you, Sir, that ſeveral Perſons were of Opinion, that K. <hi>J</hi>'s Subjects in the <hi>General De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> rather deſerted him, than that the King <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted</hi> his Subjects.</p>
            <p>And ſome judicious Men, who have read your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are inclined to believe, that you have very much juſtified K. <hi>J</hi>'s <hi>withdrawing</hi> himſelf, by the hints you give in what iminent danger his Perſon was; when you tell us of the <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>Gideon,</hi> which was old <hi>Knox</hi> his Phraſe, and now is yours for the <hi>Sword of War,</hi> the Regicides for the <hi>Sword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and the Jeſuits, as <hi>Hoſpinian</hi> tells us, for the <hi>Sword of Aſſaſſination:</hi> and I think it is all one both in Law, and Conſcience, which of the three Subjects unſheath againſt their lawful King: and if K. <hi>J.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the fate of his Anceſtors, <note n="*" place="margin">Page <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

But before I come to conſider your Arguments, I muſt freely acknowledge to you, that I am very much pre-judg'd againſt them upon the ſcore of the Primitive Chriſtians, I mean the <hi>Good old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> of the Empire, who knew all thoſe Maximes and Diſtinctions from whence you argue, as well as you do now, and yet never made uſe of any one of them in the moſt grievous Perſecutions to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Reſiſting of the Sovereign Authority.</p>

Wherefore I conclude from the Practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, that there is ſome defect or error in your way of reaſoning upon this ſubject; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I find it all overthrown in five Pages of the <hi>Hiſtery of Paſſive Obedience</hi> (which you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in honour to anſwer) excepting your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for Diſpending with the Fifth, as well as the Fourth Commandment, upon that <hi>diſtinction of the Letter from the moral Equity and Deſign of the Law.</hi> It is certainly much for your Intereſt, and the Peace of your Conſcience (if it be not yet ſeared) that the Parallel betwixt theſe two Caſes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments ſhould be exacty true. But to deal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with you, I can ſcarce believe you think ſo your ſelf, for the following reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe, as to the Power of Diſpenſing, there is a mighty Difference between a <hi>Poſitive,</hi> and a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Law; but you confound them together in your diſcourſe, for after that you had proved, that the <hi>Poſitive Precepts</hi> of the Decalogue have been, and may be Diſpenſed with, of which you give ſome Inſtances in the Sabbath; ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you conclude that the Fifth Commandment, which is a <hi>Natural</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, may in like manner be diſpens'd with too. But this is a mighty Inconſequence; becauſe the Matter of a <hi>Poſitive</hi> Precept is in it ſelf Indifferent, and becomes a duty meerly becauſe 'tis command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but in a <hi>Natural</hi> Precept the matter is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and is therefore commanded becauſe it was an antecedent Duty; and therefore, as you obſerve, the ſaving of <hi>the life of an Ox or an Aſs</hi> was preferr'd before the Obſervation of the Sabbath, but I hope you will not ſay that we make as bold with the Fifth Commandment <hi>as ſave an Ox or an Aſs.</hi> This very Inſtance may convince you, that there is a great difference between theſe two Precepts; and therefore though our Lord blamed the <hi>Jews</hi> for adhering ſo ſtrictly to the Letter or Rituality of the former, yet he blamed them more for eluding the rigour of the latter by the Vow or Oath <hi>Corban.</hi> And the reaſon is evident; for in the Fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as in all other Natural Precepts, the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Deſign of the Commandment lies in the literal ſenſe; but the Morality or Deſign of the Fourth, as in all other pure poſitive Inſtitutions, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens to be contrary to the Letter of it; and then, as you obſerve, we muſt ſtick to the deſign of the Law againſt the Letter of it. But this Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62186:4"/>hath no place in Natural Precepts, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Fifth Commandment, where the duty reſults from the relation, and cannot he ſeparated from it, but muſt hold as long as that doth. I ſay the duty of the Fifth Commandment reſults from the relation, which Children and Subjects have to the Natural and Politick Father, which is the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sovereign of every Government: and as long as he remains Rightful Sovereign, ſo long Non-reſiſtance or Submiſſion is due unto him upon the ſcore of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, from which it cannot be preſcinded ſo much as in thought.</p>
            <p>I confeſs in ſome Governments the Foundation of the relation is Temporary and Conditional, and then the relation upon the expiring of that time, or the breach of thoſe Conditions, is ſeparated from the Perſon; but in perpetual unconditional Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (ſuch as I take ours to be) the relation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated from the Perſon as long as he lives, unleſs he really Abdicates the Government; and by conſequence the duties of ſubjection, reſulting from that relation, muſt be his perpetual indiſpenſable Right; and, among the reſt, the duty of Submiſſion and Non-reſiſtance, which in the Scripture we find preſſed upon the Chriſtians in the Reigns of Princes, who, to uſe the New Diſtinction, were under the greateſt <hi>Moral Incapacity,</hi> ruling as if the People were made for Kings, without any, or very little regard to the Publick Safety, which was then, as well as now, the end of Government, and the rule by which Princes ought to Govern.</p>
            <p>In like manner, as I ſhew'd before, the Primitive Chriſtians, who undoubtedly underſtood the dutie, of Princes, were ſubject to the moſt barbarous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and in the moſt bloody Perſecutions, and yet never preſum'd to Diſpenſe with the Fifth, as <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tathias</hi> did with the Fourth Commandment; which, I doubt not but they would have Diſpenſed with to ſave the life of a Dog or Cat.</p>
            <p>I think, Sir, I have ſaid enough to ſhew what a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſt you are, if I ſhould ſay no more; but to ſhew a farther diſparity betwixt theſe two Caſes I deſire to ask you a Queſtion or two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do you think thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> would have preſum'd to have diſpenſed with the Fourth Commandment, if there had been another additional Law to make it High Treaſon, and the Tranſgreſſion of it preſent <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion</hi> of the Perſon that was the Tranſgreſſor, and loſs of all the priviledges of the Covenant to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; and moreover that your dictinction between the Moral Equity and Literal Senſe, upon which ſome in former times had preſum'd to tranſgreſs it, had been declared Traiterous and Damnable, as the Diſtinction of the <hi>Spencers</hi> was; and that after this again, upon a pretence of diſpenſing with it for the publick ſafety not many Years before, it had been declared, that it was not lawful to recede from the Litteral Senſe upon any pretence whatſoever, that neither, the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> nor the People, nor both together had any right to diſpenſe with it, or ought to pretend to the ſame, though the contrary had been practiſed. I ſay, upon ſuppoſition of all this, would <hi>Mattathias</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> have diſpenſed with the Fourth Commandment?</p>
            <p n="2">2. I deſire to know if they would have diſpenſed with it, upon ſuppoſition, that receding from the Literal Senſe would have been more pernicious to them and their Country, than keeping ſtrict to the Letter of it? Let us ſuppoſe, that by doing ſo they had entail'd a long inteſtine War upon the Nation, which would have coſt it Twenty ſuch Armies, and miſerably waſted their Country, and thereby made the Pity or Scorn of all other Nations. I ſay, upon ſuppoſition all the Calamities would have attended them that uſually follow upon reſiſting the Supreme Authority, and ſetting up one Sovereign in a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment againſt another, whether you think they would then have diſpenſed with the litteral Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath Day?

            <p>Sir, When I reflect upon theſe plain Differences between theſe two Caſes; I cannot help thinking, that you want either Skill or Probity, or it may be ſomething of both to make you a good Caſuiſt: But be it one or the other or both, I pray God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Law from ſuch Expoſitors, his Church from ſuch Paſtors, and all good Children and Subjects from ſuch Spiritual Guides. However it ſeems you have a great Opinion of your ſelf, and as mean a one of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> if you think they can be perſwaded to take the Oaths by your <hi>weak Arguments,</hi>

If it is lawful, then why may not any one ſwear he will do ſo?</hi> Now Sir, to this Argument the Underſtanding of any ordinary Curate will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this Anſwer. In ſome things it is lawful to obey K. <hi>W.</hi> and in ſome things it is not; and one of thoſe things in which I think is not lawful to obey him, is taking the Oath. Otherwiſe thus; In ſome Caſes and Circumſtances I think it lawful to obey K. <hi>W.</hi> and in others I do not: now ſo far as I can obey him, ſo far I will ſwear to obey him; but if I ſhould take the Oath, I think I ſhould ſwear to obey him further than I ought; and therefore that I may not ſwear falſely to him, which would be Perjury in the Act, nor break my former Oath, which I think would be Perjury in the Object, I will not ſwear at all.</p>
            <p>So much in reply, Sir, to your <hi>Downright De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,</hi> which you ſtole out of the <hi>Paſtoral Letter;</hi> and what right you have to ſteal other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62186:4"/>Folks Arguments, and not cite them for it, you can Beſt tell.</p>
            <p>After your Arguments to the Biſhops to induce them to take the Oath; you ſay, that if <hi>they real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtumble at it, then it is reaſonable for them to give as good ſecurity to the Government, as if they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know not, Sir what <hi>Security</hi> you mean: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the approved <hi>peaceable Temper,</hi> and <hi>quiet Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> of thoſe <hi>pious good Biſhops,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>truly Conſcientious Perſons,</hi> who had rather part with their Livelihoods than violate their Conſciences by taking the Oaths now impoſed, is a far better <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> to the Government than the Oaths of either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, or raſh turbulent Spirits, or ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Perſons, who to promote or ſecure their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Intereſt, will (as ſome of them formerly have taken both the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Engagement</hi>) ſwallow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Oaths, though never ſo apparently contradictory to their formerly <hi>Avowed Principles, Solemn Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> and <hi>Subſcriptions;</hi> or than the Oaths of ſome pretendly Scrupulous, and Tender-conſciened Men, who by their <hi>Eluſory Declarations</hi> and <hi>nice Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> endeavour to make void the obligation of the late Oaths.</p>

            <p>And then as to their being the Occaſion of ſo much Bloodſhed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> you might with as much reaſon have imputed it to their refuſing the Declaration, and their being ſent to the Tower: But, it ſeems, as ſome Men created <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of Bleſſed Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo you treat the Biſhops: they were in Profeſſion his moſt Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, but that they might make the People to hate him, they imputed all the Bloodſhed in <hi>Ireland</hi> to his Majeſty; and juſt ſo <hi>the Biſhops are Reverend Perſons, for whom you have as great and true a Veneration, as any can pretend to,</hi> but you lay the Blood ſhed in <hi>Ireland</hi> at their Doors to make the People hate them. But, God be thanked, it is ſomewhat too late to raiſe the Rabble upon them; and all the World knows the not reducing of <hi>Ireland</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bloodſhed is owing to other Cauſes; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Sir, the Biſhops are beholding to you for making them the occaſion of it; and when God ſhall make Inquiſition for that Blood, it will be happy for you, if you be found as innocent and free from the guilt of it, as they are, I know they have Charity enough to forgive you, though you know what you do: But, Sir, God will not forgive you, unleſs you can bring your ſelf to ſuch a Temper, as to ask their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and make them amends for the Injuries you have done, unto them; for in the ſame Period, by the help of your old Servant <hi>But,</hi> you alſo impute the refuſing of the the Oath <hi>to humour,</hi> and repreſent their deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as their <hi>own Choice:</hi> And indeed it was their own Choice, as their going to the Tower was, and they alſo <hi>deprive themſelves,</hi> as you expreſs it; and ſo their old Friends the <hi>R.</hi> C's ſaid they ſent themſelves to the Tower. Unfortunate Men! that are ſtill ſo bent upon their own Ruin; and <hi>why,</hi> ſaid another of their back Friends, <hi>ſhould we pity Men that will not pity themſelves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then with all the Civility in the World you go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to tell them, that the People (forſooth) will not be ſo ſenſible of their worth, as to be concerned for their Sufferings, and that they are miſtaken in the computation in the number of their Friends, as K. <hi>J.</hi> was of his by the Addreſſes to him. But, Sir, how abſurd and incongruous is your Compariſon: for when K. <hi>J.</hi> received the Addreſſes, he was in the height of his Majeſty as King; but theſe Biſhops e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince the Revolution have been in their Declenſion, and ſince the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> looked upon as Men who are not of this World; and if any, either Clergy-men or Lay-men, have ſince expreſt their Duty and concern for them, they have no reaſon to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their Sincerity, but on the contrary to believe, that they are their Friends in reality as well as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. No, Sir, they are the Men of Greatneſs, and the Favourites of Princes, who have moſt reaſon to fear that they are out in their <hi>Computation;</hi> and if it were not to gratiſie ſome Mens Vanity by the Compariſon, I would beg leave to mind them of Cardinal <hi>Woolſey;</hi> for if ever they fall but half as low as he did, they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62186:5"/>find themſelves as much not out in their Account, as you impudently ſay the Biſhops were in <hi>the number of the Clergy who would take the Oaths,</hi> and have their new Retinue reduc'd, as you tell us the Church of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> was, to one ſingle Perſon; and then their Clients and Flatterers, who worſhipt before, will ſtand afar off, and ſay like thoſe of <hi>Sejanus,</hi>

            <p>In the concluſion of your Letter you tell us, you do not think there is ſuch a great ſcarcity of worthy Men in the Church, but that <hi>it may be poſſible to find out four or five as good, who may be able to ſupply the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops places, and come up to their pitch.</hi> Now, Sir, that there is no ſcarcity of good men in the Church is very true, neither would there have been any, tho you had not come among them: but that any learned Men of true Moral Worth and Goodneſs can accept the Biſhopricks to be vacated by the Deprivation of thoſe excellent Perſons, is a Paradox to my belief. Howbeit I doubt not but they will be ſupplied by Men worthy, if not by worthy Men: And as to thoſe Two Perſons, who have ſucceeded in the Two laſt Vacancies, I dare be bold to ſay, that it would have blaſted all the Reputation they have acquired, if they had ſucceeded, (as ſome I hear are ready to do) in the ſuſpended Biſhops Sees; for Underſtanding and Good Men would have looked upon them no better, than the Faithful <hi>Alexandrians</hi> did upon <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> who ſucceſſively filled the Chair of St. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> when he was deprived. All the Authority of the Emperor and Synod of <hi>Antioch</hi> could not reconcile them to ſuch Succeſſors; which <hi>Euſebius Emiſenus</hi> foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prudently declined the Biſhoprick when it was offer'd to him. I wiſh ſome Venerable Me, whoſe Reputations are yet recoverable, would conſider what reaſon there is to follow his Example: but if they ſhall think fit to take their Chairs, and any good People ſhall think it their Duty nevertheleſs to adhere to their old Biſhops and Metropolitan, then it ſhall be diſputed upon true Catholick Principles, on which ſide the Shiſm lies.</p>
            <p>I have now, Sir, run thro' your Letter; and leaſt I ſhould have omitted any thing in it, which I ſhould have anſwer'd; or not perfectly anſwer'd any thing in it, which I did not omit: to ſupply either, or both of thoſe Defects, I refer you to the following paſſages which I deſire you to conſult, <hi>viz.
